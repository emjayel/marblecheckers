#marblecheckers
My final project for Computer Science 2. 
Jump a marble over another marble to remove the jumped-over-marble from the board. 
Marbles and spaces are represented by buttons on a grid. 
Marbles are red (yellow when selected), empty spaces are blue, and invalid spaces are black. 
The text field at the bottom of the display presents error messages (for invalid moves) and notifications if the game has been won (only one marble left) or lost (no legal moves left). 
"Reset" button (obviously) resets the game.
